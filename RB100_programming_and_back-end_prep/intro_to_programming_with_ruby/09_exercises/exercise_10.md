## Question
Can hash values be arrays? Can you have an array of hashes? (give examples)

## Solution

Yes, hash values can be arrays.
```ruby
family_members = {
  parents: ["Emmanuel", "Cindy"],
  brothers: ["Henry", "Marshal"],
  sisters: ["Juith", "Pearl"]
}
```

Yes, you can have an array of hashes.
