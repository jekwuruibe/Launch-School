## Large Numbers
Using the ruby documentation, determine how you can write large numbers in a way that makes them easier to read.

## Solution
Ruby allows for the use of the underscore character `( _ )` to make large numbers easier to read. Example: `134,687,500` is written like so in Ruby `134_687_500` which is also the same as `134687500`.
